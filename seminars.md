== Fall 2016

=== An Introduction to Git and GitHub

_by Brian Yu_

Git is a powerful piece of version control software that helps you to keep track of different versions of your code, collaborate on your code with other people, and experiment with new changes to your code. It's used in industry, in many open-source projects, and in many computer science courses here at Harvard. This seminar will be a hands-on opportunity for you to learn how to leverage the features offered by Git and GitHub.

=== Automated Analysis of Music and Audio

_by Vivek Jayaram_

The intersection of music and CS is an interesting field with many applications, such as Shazam, Auto-Tune, and other automated methods. This seminar will not focus on creating music, but rather analyzing and manipulating existing audio files. A background in music theory is beneficial but not recommended, and non-musical applications to general audio will also be discussed. Topics include fourier transforms, spectrograms, machine learning methods, beat/key detection, isolation of sounds, and structure detection.

=== Essential Scale-Out Computing

_by James Cuff_

Each day you interact with thousands upon thousands of processors, servers, storage systems and high-speed networks. You don't see them, and you don't physically touch them, but they are there, making everything happen behind the scenes. Everything is powered by advanced computing, from your morning news, movie and video streams, phone conversations, currency, financial markets, pharmaceuticals, navigation, traffic, weather, email and of course all of our social media updates.  Each of us consumes vast amounts of data and computation on a daily basis. We also continue to push the boundaries of our science and discovery. Using ever more complex computer models to peer into the darkness of space or to understanding the genetic basis as to why were are human. All of this needs computing for it to work correctly, and it also needs advanced infrastructure and distributed computing architectures to work quickly.  James Cuff is the Assistant Dean for Research Computing here at Harvard. His group runs more than sixty thousand high performance computing processors and more than fourteen petabytes of storage for science. On a global scale, this system is tiny. However, he will show you real world examples of the advances in computation science, physical infrastructure and distributed computing systems we are using each day, whether you are a particle physicist trying to reverse engineer the very fabric of the universe – or maybe you are just updating your selfie...  So what will you learn from this seminar? You are all designing software for your final project. Facebook for example, was originally designed as a small single server PHP application. In order to make it scale to today’s hundreds of thousands of servers and billions of users took years. James will explain how both datacenter and systems architectures that now surpass electrical power usage of 10-20 megawatts – (enough to power more than 20,000 houses, nearly half of the City of Cambridge) enable today’s applications to scale. Each computation, be it add, subtract, multiply, divide, strcmp(), grep or memory hash lookup you make in your application now matters. You will be shown not only how distributed computing factors into your applications, but also how the actual energy efficiency of your algorithms matters. Designing, and thinking about how your application will scale from the beginning to potentially manage 10,000’s of page impressions a second is now the new normal.

_by Billy Janitsch '15_

APIs allow you to programmatically access data from websites in a useful
form. Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, Google Maps, Freebase, Wikipedia,
last.fm, Digg, and even CS50 all have APIs that you can use to work with
a variety of interesting data. Have another source in mind? There's
probably an APP for that. Oops, I mean an API. All familiarity levels
welcome, and those in search of ideas for a cool final project are
particularly encouraged to attend.

=== Defending Behind The Device: Mobile Application Security

_by Chris Wysopal_

Risks to mobile devices are similar to those of traditional software
applications and a result of insecure coding practices, privacy
violating design, and malicious intent. But mobile devices aren’t just
small computers: they are designed around personal and communication
functionality. This makes the top mobile applications risks different
from the top traditional computing risks - and an easier opportunity for
those with malicious intent. This presentation will discuss the threat
landscape and how developers and enterprise IT can tackle mobile app
risk.

=== JavaScript Frameworks: Why and How?

_by Kevin Schimd '15_

JavaScript! It's awesome when you want to add interactive, client-side
features to a website. But coding large projects in JavaScript can be
difficult: it's tough to keep track of events, and maintain organization
of the code! Enter in JavaScript frameworks, which are useful in solving
these kinds of issues. In this seminar, we'll dive into the details and
aspects of some frameworks, and discuss what kind of design challenges
they address. Some knowledge of JavaScript, such as events and objects,
is ideal, but not necessary.

=== Kohana: A Lightweight PHP Framework

_by Brandon Liu '14_

Web frameworks are absolutely essential for making websites: They
organize your code so that it's more maintainable, and they take care of
common problems like user input sanitation and data model validation so
that you don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time. There are
dozens of web frameworks out there, but Kohana is one of the easiest to
learn, while still providing plenty of features. It's written in PHP, so
there's no need to learn a new language! The seminar will be a
live-coding session, building a blog from the ground up using Kohana.
Students are free to code along, but I will be moving quickly to cover
more ground.

=== Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions

_by John Mussman '12_

Regular expressions are templates that allow computers to find and match
patterns in text. Pattern matching is useful when analyzing user input
on consumer websites, cleaning experimental data, or mining source texts
for statistical information. This seminar gives students conceptual
strategies for converting patterns into regular expressions; practice
using the Python re library to solve puzzles; and background to use the
many implementations of regular expressions in command-line tools and
languages including Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, C#, PHP, and MYSQL.

=== Preparing Your Site for the Web

_by Yuechen Zhao '15_

Designing and launching a website today is a more complex than simply
whipping up some HTML and CSS. You must also take additional steps to
ensure that your site is ready for the web, as websites are being viewed
on different browsers and platforms by people all over the world. How
can you be certain that your site will thrive under all conditions?
Topics to be discussed include cross-browser/platform compatibility, web
security, error handling, and performance optimization.

=== Surviving the Internet

_by Esmond Kane_

This seminar will be a truncated version of the National Cyber Security
Awareness Month presentations available here: http://hvrd.me/Rx1Se9
During this year, a record number of popular online service providers,
ranging from email, to social media, to cloud file sharing, were
compromised resulting in our data being exposed. Now, more than ever, we
need to be mindful of the need for constant vigilance when it comes to
computer security. To protect yourself from cyber risks, here are some
things you can do: 1. Ensure your computer has been set to automatically
update 2. Enable your computer's operating system firewall 3. Install
antivirus software and ensure it is set to automatically update 4.
Install HTTPS and anti-tracking extensions 5. Only save your passwords
to a password safe, never save passwords to your browser 6. Select a
unique password for each of your accounts, do not use a common password
for all of your accounts 7. Use two-factor authentication for accounts
that offer it, for example, Google, PayPal, Dropbox, Facebook and many
others offer free or low cost two-factor authentication 8. Be suspicious
of opening email you were not expecting, or from someone you do not
know, and never reply to an email asking for your password 9. Consider
encrypting your hard disk using your computer's operating system
encryption program, for example, FileVault or BitLocker 10. Back up your
hard disk; make a local backup AND make an online backup of important
data.

=== Unix Shells, Environments

_by Douglas Kline_

Unix shells consist of and depend on environments and other provisions
that differ from those of other operating systems. Unix offers several
different shells which have some things in common with each other. One,
bash, is now becoming available on other operating systems and may
become shell-lingua franca. Understanding the bases of the shells, their
various capabilities, and how they differ from each other can greatly
increase one's capabilities of using Unix and also illustrate the
history and development of the shells and the operating system in
general. Understanding how they differ from shells of other operating
systems can promote understanding of both and forestall confusion and
mistakes. I intend this primarily as a practical seminar as the topic
isn't really theoretical and the broader historical implications have
more to do with the irregular, idiosyncratic origins of Unix rather than
principles of computer science.

=== Vim: Speed and Power at your Fingertips

_by Brandon Liu '14_

Vim is one of the most popular text editors used by programmers. It is
generally agreed that Vim allows for faster text editing than any other
application, but there is a misconception that Vim has a extremely steep
learning curve. With the proper instruction and guidance, you'll find
yourself coding in Vim in no time, faster than ever before! This seminar
will start with a showcase of what Vim is capable of, and then break out
into a hands-on workshop where everyone gets their hands dirty with some
Vim practice!

=== Accelerating Science with the Open Science Grid

by Ian Stokes-Rees

In the mid-1990s, the high-energy physics community (think
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermilab[FermiLab] and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cern[CERN]) started planning for the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider[Large Hadron
Collider]. Managing the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte[petabytes]
of data that would be generated by the facility and sharing it with the
globally distributed community of over 10,000 researchers would be a
major infrastructure and technology problem. This same community that
brought us the web has now developed standards, software, and
infrastructure for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing[grid
computing]. In this seminar I'll present some of the exciting science
that is being done on the

=== Acing Your Technical Interviews

by Tony Ho '14

At Harvard, there aren't many programs that help people practice their
interviews, especially if there is coding involved. To help with this, I
would like to teach people about resources that are out there that can
help with making sure everyone can ace their interviews.

Most coding interviews are like another coding competition. I would like
to start by talking about resources like
http://projecteuler.net/[Project Euler], Poj,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USACO[USACO],
http://codeforces.com/[Codeforces],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TopCoder[Topcoder]. Then I will move into
the broad topics that everyone needs to know to answer simple questions.
Finally, I will end with a hands-on period where we will try some
problems and go over some problems that I have personally seen and find
very interesting.

http://lite.textmarks.com/dev/[TextMarks Lite] APIs, in conjunction with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP[PHP] scripts, to develop interactive
SMS applications. SMS (i.e. text messages) is a nearly-universal
technology on cell phones. It allows developers to create mobile
applications that are cheap and compatible with all phones, whether
you're using a smartphone (iPhone, Blackberry, G1) or your parents' old
black-and-white Nokia. If you're thinking about changing the world, SMS
has been a useful platform for the developing world where few serviced
populations have access to advanced mobile devices. Farmers in many
African countries are now able to get up-to-date pricing and other
agricultural data thanks to SMS applications. In Kenya, mobile (SMS)
banking is rapidly changing the way Kenyans create and conduct business.
Whether you're interested in updating
http://shuttleboy.cs50.net/[Shuttleboy] or solving world peace, this
seminar will be a good starting point.

=== Scraping Data from the Internet

by Keito Uchiyama '11

Stocks, sports scores, dining menus--there's a plethora of information
out there on the Internet that's not available by easily accessible
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface[Application
Programming Interfaces] (APIs).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping[Web scraping], or screen
scraping in general, helps extract that data by parsing the HTML on web
pages, making data from any website on the Internet accessible to your
application and prime for mashing up in whatever creative way you can
imagine. We'll go over an example,
http://CrimsonDining.org/[CrimsonDining.org], which uses robust scraping
to retrieve menu data from Dining Services. The techniques covered in
this seminar will apply to any programming language or framework.

=== Visualizing Data and Data Art with Processing

by Filip Zembowicz '11

http://www.processing.org[Processing] is an open-source programming
language based on Java and designed with visualization in mind. It is
for students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists for
learning, prototyping, and production of graphics, both static and
interactive. It is used intensively in the class CS 171: Visualization,
taught by Hanspeter Pfister. This tutorial will cover basic processing
fundamentals, including loading data, drawing complex shapes from
primitives, physics, and handling user interaction. These programs can
then be run online or through downloadable executables.

=== Visualizing Data Interactively: A Primer on Actionscript, Flex, and the Flare Visualization Library

by Filip Zembowicz '11

Large datasets are everywhere nowadays: information on populations,
biology, voting, prices, and distances are just a few of the various
categories of data easily accessible online. However, many of these
resources suffer from poor user interface design--it is hard for a user
to see the information holistically, to see patterns in data, to observe
how the data changes over time, and to remain engaged with static blocks
of text and images. Information visualization allows for the facile
design of engaging ways to explore data. In this tutorial, I will
introduce Actionscript (the language that powers Flash animations) and
http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/[Flex] (an Adobe product that allows
rapid development of web-based flash apps), specifically focusing on how
the http://flare.prefuse.org/[Flare] visualization library can be
utilized to load, display, and interact with quantitative, qualitative,
and relative data. Examples of beautiful visualizations:
http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/.

Adobe has recently announced that the forthcoming Flash CS5 will be able
to run on iPhone -- this represents a tremendous opportunity for getting
into the mobile wave.

=== Voice Application Development

by Wellie Chao '98

Provide information and services to users over the phone using speech
synthesis,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency[dual-tone
multi-frequency] (DTMF) capture, and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network[public
switched telephone network] (PSTN) connectivity. Build voice telephony
applications using scripting languages such as Perl and Python
configured with XML. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSWITCH[FreeSWITCH]
is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol[SIP]-compliant
softswitch that lets you talk to other softswitches, softphones, IP
phones, and (via SIP) the PSTN to reach (or be reached by) any mobile
phone or landline around the world. The CS50
http://shuttleboy.cs50.net[Shuttleboy Voice] application (617-BUG-CS50 /
617-284-2750) is built on FreeSWITCH. Organizations such as
http://www.delta.com/[Delta Airlines],
http://www.capitalone.com/[Capital One],
http://www.citibank.com/[Citibank], and even
http://www.harvard.edu/[Harvard] use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response[interactive
voice response] (IVR) systems to provide information to customers such
as flight times, bank balances, and dinner menus, and to allow customers
to perform transactions such as booking tickets, transferring money,
making payments. With FreeSWITCH and your favorite programming language
(C/Java/Perl/Python/PHP/Javascript/Ruby/etc.), building such systems is
a snap. In addition, FreeSWITCH has some cool features such as receiving
faxes, sending dynamically generated faxes, integration with
http://www.google.com/talk/[Google Talk], mixing of audio streams from
multiple sources such as other phone lines for conferencing or local
files/shoutcast.
